# 🖥️ Personal Portfolio

Hey! This is my personal portfolio built using **React** and **TypeScript**. It showcases my web development projects, skills, and a bit about me. I’ve also used some cool libraries for animations and styling to make it look awesome.

## 👨‍💻 Tech Stack

- **React** – For building the UI.  
- **TypeScript** – Because types make life easier.  
- **CSS Modules** – For clean and modular styles.  
- **Framer Motion** – Smooth animations for a better user experience.  
- **GSAP** – Advanced animations for those fancy effects.  
- **React Router** – For navigation between pages.
